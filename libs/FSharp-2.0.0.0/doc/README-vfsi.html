<h1> Using F# Interactive in Visual Studio</h1>

<p>
If you use Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 (including the
freely available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=40646580-97FA-4698-B65F-620D4B4B1ED7&displaylang=en">Visual Studio 2008 Shell</a> and 
the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=8E5AA7B6-8436-43F0-B778-00C3BCA733D3&displaylang=en">Visual Studio 2010 Integrated Shell</a>), 
you can use  'F# Interactive' as a tool window!   </p>

<h4>Starting F# Interactive</h4>

<p> To start the session, go to the View -> Other Windows and select 'F# Interactive'. You can also start a session
simply using <tt>Alt-Return</tt> in an F# source document, or using the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F.</p>


<h4>Editing and Evaluating a Script</h4>

<p>You create a script file using File -> New File -> Script -> F# Script File.</p>

<p> The normal mode of operation is to edit an F# script file and send fragments for execution in the tool window. In
this mode, your fragments are typechecked as you type, and you are actively working towards a completed 
file that can act as the finished product of your explorative programming. The tool window is then
just used for displaying data.</p>

<p>In the script file, you should use <tt>#r</tt> and <tt>#I</tt> to reference assemblies 
and augment your assembly include path.</p>


<p>The session is global to the instance of Visual Studio and text can be sent from any
F# source code file (.fs, .fsi, .fsx, .ml, .mli).
Use the <tt>Alt-Return</tt> combination to evaluate
selected text. For example, highlight <tt>printfn "Hello World"</tt> and use this key combination - the code will then
execute.  </p>


<h4>Execution Context for Scripts</h4>


<p>The F# Interactive session executes only those code fragments you direct it to. If you select a fragment from
half-way through your script, earlier portions of the script will not be executed implicitly. </p>

<p>When sending text from a file, file names are resolved relative to the scripts containing the reference.  Visual F# Interactive sets the 
line and directory context of the session each time an entry is sent from Visual Studio, though it doesn't
adjust the value of <tt>System.Environment.CurrentDirectory</tt>. It can be useful to add  </p>
<pre>
    System.Environment.CurrentDirectory <- __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__
</pre>
<p>to your script. <tt>__SOURCE_DIRECTORY</tt> can be used in any F# source file and is expanded to the directory
containing the file.</p>


<h4>Organizing Your Scripts</h4>

<p> Although scripts can be authored without a project, it can be useful to create an F# Project to hold a group of related scripts.  
You can do this with <tt>New Project</tt> or by making a copy of one of the projects in 
the F# Samples directory. You can also use <tt>#load</tt> to load both signature and implementation files as
if they have been compiled as compilation units by the command-line compiler.</p>


<h4>Controlling the Evaluation Session</h4>

<p>In the tool window, <tt>#quit;;</tt> will quit and Ctrl+C will cancel execution. 
The context menu in the tool window includes 
"Reset Session" and "Cancel Evaluation" commands.
If you do type into the tool window, history is available with the up/down arrows.  </p>
